            League of Legends (abbreviated LoL or League) is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game
            developed
            and published by Riot Games.
            Inspired by a modified version of Warcraft III called Defense of the Ancients, Riot's founders sought to
            develop a stand-alone game in the same genre.
            Since its release in October 2009, the game has been free-to-play, and is monetized through purchasable
            character customization.
            The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.
            <br> </br>
            In the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player combat, with each team occupying and
            defending their own half of the map.
            Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing
            styles of play.
            During a match, champions collect experience points to gain levels and purchase items in order to defeat the
            opposing team.
            In the game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying
            their "nexus", a large structure located within it.

                These are typically the player positions on a team:
                <ul>
                    <li>Top Laner</li>
                    <li>Mid Laner</li>
                    <li>Jungler</li>
                    <li>AD Carry</li>
                    <li>Support</li>
                </ul>
            </p1>
            </br> </br>
            League of Legends received generally positive reviews, with critics highlighting its accessibility,
            character designs, and production value.
            The player base's negative and abusive in-game behavior, criticized at release, persists.
            In 2019, the game regularly peaked at eight million concurrent players, and has a large following on
            streaming platforms, such as YouTube and Twitch.
            Its popularity has led to merchandise and tie-ins, such as music videos, comic books, short stories, and an
            upcoming animated series.
            The game's success has spawned several spin-offs, including a mobile version, a digital collectible card
            game, and an in-development massively multiplayer online role-playing game.
